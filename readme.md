# Coder vs Bugs

When I started coding to make a game using pygame, I did not think I'd end up with this. I was trying to make a clone of the 2013's addicting game "Flappy Bird".
As the project came to conclusion, a different idea using the same concept came to my mind, resulting to the game you're seeing right now.
The game is simple, a coder tries avoiding bugs and errors, and when he/she meets one, the game is terminated. Unlike real life, where each bug teaches us a direct or an indirect lesson keep in mind, this game is quite different, DO NOT MAKE ERRORS HERE

## Usage

The same starts instantly and to survive, you'll have to make sure that you do not crash eith the bugs or do not fall down. Each mouse click bounces you above, and idly, you fall down.
So balance the mouse click and avoid the bugs in order to survive.
